For this project I was in a group with Amelia, Nina, Folu and Beth. Because our
group was so large we decided to make two projects. We initially planned to make
a high-tech whoopee cushion and a cloak which lit up.</p>
<p>I mainly worked on the whoppee cushion. Our plan was to connect a speaker to
  a seat cushion which would play various amusing noises when sat on. To achieve
  this we used circuitPython on a CircuitPlaygroundExpress board. The first
  problem we came across was it was difficult to convert sound files to the
  correct file type. We did eventually fix this but because of the time involved
  in converting each file we ran out of time to add most of our files. We also
  had some difficulties with the light sensor (which we were using to detect
  when the cushion was sat on). It took us a long time to work out how the get
  input from it and once we did it still sometimes randomly started using the
  light sensor on the board. We never exactly fixed that, it just stopped
  happening as much eventually. The final complication was that it turned out
  that the speakers we bought didn't work with our board so we had to have it
  play sounds really quietly using the on-board speaker.</p>
<p>Despite the problems we experienced we did manage to produce a cushion which
  could be changed between three modes. One screamed when the cushion was sat
  on, one laughed maniacally and one played a ba-dum-tss soudn effect. The modes
  could be switched between using the buttons on the board, which is not ideal
  as it's quite awkward to use them but it was funcitonal so I count this project
  as a sucess.</p>
<p>The cloak which lit up proved to be too difficult to sew so we ended up with
  a shirt which lit up when turned on. Due to lack of time and difficulties with
  connecting to the computer, we did not program the lights to flash, which was
  our plan. We did however produce a functional light-up shirt.
