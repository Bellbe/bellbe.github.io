  <h2>Until 19/03</h2>
  <div class="main"><p>Spent way too long making this website (particually on
  the abortive attempt to have the log be interactive). Decided on learning
  Python as my first project. Did the free bit of Grok learning for Python.</p>
  <p>My aim for this project is to get enough of an understanding of Python to
  make basic mathematical models, and possibly make one. I don't know how
  ambitious this is as I have almost no experience programming so I'll settle
  for just doing some online course.</p></div></div></div>

<div class="background"><div class="log">
  <h2>26/03</h2>
  <div class="main"><p>I have finished fourteen of the eighteen lessons in the
  Computer Science Circles python course. I am finding it useful and not too
  difficult although it is challenging.<p>
  <p>Given how long it has taken me to get this far, I will need to work faster
  (and probably over Easter) in order to finish both the course and a project by
  the end of term. My goal for this week is to complete the course and have a
  definite idea of what I'm doing for my project by the first lesson next week
  (04/04).</p></div></div></div>

<div class="background"><div class="log">
  <h2>04/04</h2>
  <div class="main"><p>Over Easter I tried to do more of the Computer Science
    Circles course but could not work out how to complete some of the
    activities. Rather than use the last of my time in class finishing this, I
    would like to apply what I've learnt so far to create something. This will
    let me see whether I have achieved as much as I hoped I would and what I
    should focus on learning in the future.</p>
    <p>During the break I also wrote the beginning of a program to model a
    question from a maths assignment to check that this is not widly outside of
    my skillset. The plan is to model the problem "A sphere with a radius of
    length 12cm has a cylinder inscribed within it. For the cylinder: find its'
    volume for a given height and find its' volume for a given radius."
    I think I will be able to do it so over the next week my aim
    is to complete the project. Currently the program only works for a set
    sphere radius and will only work if the input has a cylinder radius or
    height in lowercase, with an equals sign before the value. Along with
    actually making it work, I would like to have it accept differenct spere
    dimensions and be less picky about how inputs are worded</p></div></div>
</div>

<div class="background"><div class="log">
  <h2>09/04</h2>
  <div class="main"><p>I forgot to bring in my maths assignment with the start
    of the formulas for actually getting the output for the second time so I
    have spent the last two lessons coding the collecting input part of my
    project. I'm actually very happy with it. It now accepts different sphere
    radius' and more flexible inputs.</p>
    <p>Over the coming week/the holidays I will need to work out the formulas I
    am using, add them to my code and test it. This shouldn't take me too long
    so my aim is to complete this project by the end of this week.</p>
