<div id="div1"> How To Design a Good Website </div>

<div id="div2"> Design </div>
<div id="div3">
Having too many contrasting colours will make a website confusing to look at. Make most of the colours 
similar, using contrast sparingly to draw attention to important aspects of the site (or things you want 
people to interact with, such as links to other pages).
White space behind text and around images will make them easier to read or look at and make your website 
look more refined.
</div>
<br>
<div id="div2"> Text </div>
<div id="div3">
Be concise, too much waffle makes reading a page a chore. 
Organise the information under logical headings to make it easy to sort through. 
Use an easy-to-read, modern font. Sans serif and not one of the handwriting ones or comic sans is a good 
bet.
</div>
<br>
<div id="div2"> Layout </div>
<div id="div3">
Simple design will make a website easier to understand. The information on each page should be quick to 
read through. 
Organising information with the most important at the top left of the page (where people will look first) 
will also help to get your point across and let people know what the point of each page is. 
Placing objects (text and images) on your website in a grid will stop it looking messy and 
amateur.
</div>
<br>
<div id="div2">Usability</div>
<div id="div3">
Make navigating the website easy, group things together in a way people will expect to make it easier to 
find them. 
If you have multiple pages, have a menu somewhere obvious and limit the number of items in it 
so it's quick to scan through. 
Try to minimise the time it takes your page to load. Images make the page look nicer but take a lot of 
time to load, especially if you have lots of high quality.
If possible, make the webpage responsive to the device it is being viewed on. It is always annoying to 
try to access a website only to find it either doesn't work on your device or the layout is so messed up 
that it is effectively unusable.
