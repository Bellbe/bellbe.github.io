  <div class="main"><p>Decided on making a website for flashcards as my project.
    This is something I want to use so that should provide motivation for me to
  finish it. This is what I'd written in a note from ages ago about this idea,
  "Make an app/website which takes a list of things, makes them into flash cards
  with videos on the back and randomises them. I would need to learn how to:
  <ul><li>get input to become a permanent part of the app/site</li>
    <li>Attach images/photos</li>
    <li>Maybe have logins/users"</li>
  </ul></p></div></div></div>

    <h2>10/05</h2>
    <div class="main"><p>Over the past few lessons I have started making a
    skeleton website which I can later add JavaScript to. I spent a bit of time
    off task trying to create a dropdown menu which could be operated on a
    phone.  The way I was trying to accomplish this was having a javascript
    linked button which made the dropdowns visible. I wound up giving up on that
    because it's more a gimic than something which needs to be done so I can
    start working on the back end of the website (my aim at the moment).
    Despite not being directly useful, I think this helped me to understand the
    basics of JavaScript, so it wasn't entirely wasted time. If I finish in
    time to fix up the design of the site I would really like to return to this
    and get the menu working.

  <div class="main"><p>
    I have a very basic skeleton webpage. Currently all it has is an input field
    with a submit button (eventually this will add whatever is in the input
    field to a list of cards) and a show card button (should pick a random card
    from that list and show it). I will also need to make a way of adding the
    back of cards. My plan is to have another input field which will add to a
    different list. So long as the two lists are equal length, the same spot on
    each list should be the front and back of the same card. Currently though,
    I want to focus on working out how to have input saved permanently. I
    tried to start looking into that but couldn't get anything to work. I'll
    need to get help.

    <div class="main"><p>
      I've written code which should be saving input to a text file using
      StreamReader/Writer. It's not working though. Aim for next lesson is to
      work out why.</p></div></div></div>

    <div calss="main"><p>
      I worked out that it doesn't work when I try to import System.IO I don't
      know why it does that and neither does Mr. Morffew so now I'm waiting to
      find out.</p>

<div class="background"><div class="log">
  <h2>7/06</h2>
  <div class="main"><p>
    It turned out it wasn't working because it wasn't possible. There is
    something else which should be able to do the same thing called node.js
    My goal is now to work out how that works as quickly as possible.
  </p></div></div></div>

  <h2>16/06</h2>
  <div class="main"><p>
    I wound up not having time to learn how a new thing worked and get an even
    semi-functional website so I've given up on having input be permanent for
    now. The site works pretty well for what it does. Even though I haven't
    actually learnt any of the three things I said I wanted to, I feel like this
    project went quite well. I did use some JavaScript, which I'd never done
    before. I think I know enough about this now to at least know what to
    look into in the future to make it work. I would really like to revisit this
    project at some point and actually get it working.</p></div></div></div>
