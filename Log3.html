  <div class="main"><p> As my third project I'm going to finish making my
    flashcards website. The website I made in the last project kinda works as a
    basis to add features to. At the most basic, I need to add the ability to
    add new cards and have them permanantely save (and delete old sets). I would
    also like to be able to add photos/videos, have people create accounts (so
    their card sets wont show up for everyone) and have the whole set you're
    accessing visible somewhere. That's quite a lot though so I'm just going to
    aim for adding new cards. </p>
    <p>One of the mistakes I made last time was trying to learn just what I
    needed for the project which didn't give me enough background knowledge
    to achieve what I wanted to. This time I'm going to start by doing some of
    the node.js course on w3 schools because I'm fairly sure that will actually
    let me write to and read a file (yay! Finally!).
