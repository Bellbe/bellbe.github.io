  <div class="main"><p> As my third project I'm going to finish making my
    flashcards website. The website I made in the last project kinda works as a
    basis to add features to. At the most basic, I need to add the ability to
    add new cards and have them permanantely save (and delete old sets). I would
    also like to be able to add photos/videos, have people create accounts (so
    their card sets wont show up for everyone) and have the whole set you're
    accessing visible somewhere. That's quite a lot though so I'm just going to
    aim for adding new cards. </p>
    <p>One of the mistakes I made last time was trying to learn just what I
    needed for the project which didn't give me enough background knowledge
    to achieve what I wanted to. This time I'm going to start by doing some of
    the node.js course on w3 schools because I'm fairly sure that will actually
    let me write to and read a file (yay! Finally!).

    <div class="main"><p> I'm changing groups to work with Nina and Amelia on a
    ROV for the remainder of this project (and next one). I haven't achieved
    much in this project as their kept being things which I didn't have enough
    experience to understand. The main problem I had was that I didn't realise
    I couldn't actually store information online with the software I was using
    until far enough through the project that I didn't have time to learn how to
    use something new. I did learn a bit more about node.js but couldn't find
    any information on how to make that interact with HTML and other files.
    This meant that I couldn't really make much progress past learning the
    basics of node. I'd still like to complete this at some point but it
    probably won't be during this course.</p>
