  <div class="main"><p>My aim for this project was to learn some simple coding
  skills in Python. I wanted to learn skills which I could see having actual
  applications which could be useful to me. Obviously, I have not learnt enough
  to code anything of use right now, but I did learn enough that I can see how
  programming could be useful if I get better at it. Over the past month, I did
  an online python course and wrote a program to read input and complete a
  simple math problem.
<p>The course that I did was from Computer Science Circles. The topics I
  completed were:
<ul><li>Variables</li>
<li>Errors</li>
<li>Functions</li>
<li>Comments and Quotes</li>
<li>Types</li>
<li>Input</li>
<li>If</li>
<li>Design, Debugging and Donuts</li>
<li>Strings</li>
<li>Math</li>
<li>Loops</li>
<li>Else, And, Or, Not</li>
<li>def</li>
<li>Variable Scope</li>
<li>Lists (Arrays)</li>
<li>Methods</li></ul>
While learning this, I wrote programs to complete small tasks. One of these was making a Python program which acted like a BASIC program with only goto and end commands (reading an input, if it's a goto command go to the line with the label that is the target of the goto statement or if it's an end statement then ending the program). I had to get a lot of help while working through some of the course but I feel like I understand the topics I completed. There are three topics and two 'major' practice problems which I did not complete. So that is one thing I could do to improve my outcomes from this project.</p>

<p>I did not entirely finish the course because I wanted to write my own
  program. I decided on modelling a problem from a maths assignment I had,
  modified to make it more interesting to code. The problem I wound up with is,
   "a sphere has a cylinder inscribed within it. For a given radius or height
   of the cylinder, find its greatest possible volume". Using rep.it, I
   successfully wrote a program to do this (attached).</p>

<p>For the first few lessons I spent on my program, I forgot to bring in my
  maths assignment which had the formula I needed to program in. Because of
  that, I had a lot of spare time to fix problems with the project such as not
  accepting inputs unless they were written typ=number. I accomplished that by
  adding a function to find the number in any string and only scanning the
  first letter to determine the type. Obviously, there were some bugs. I fixed
  them using the code visualiser from Computer Science Circles, which let me s
  tep through what was happening when I ran my program to see which line wasn't
  working.</p>

<p>If I had longer on this, the first thing I would do would be more thoroughly
  test it by working out examples by hand, as I only had time for a few tests.
  After that, the main addition I would like to make would be to get the
  program to simplify square roots by factoring out perfect squares when giving
  precise values (at the moment it could say something like 2√(25)π which,
  while correct, would be better expressed as 10π).</p></div></div></div>
